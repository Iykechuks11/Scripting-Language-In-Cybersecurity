# Scripting Language(s) in cybersecurity

> This repo is a collection of codes mastered, and projects I completed using (Perl, JavaScript, and PHP) during my second semester as a cybersecurity graduate student at Kadir Has University, Istanbul, Turkey.

## Tools I employed:

- [Geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/perl-tutorial-learn-perl-with-examples)

At the beginning of course, we started with
**PERL - Practical Extraction and Reporting Language**.

**Perl** is a general-purpose, high level interpreted and dynamic programming language. At the beginning level, Perl was developed only for system management and text handling but in later versions, Perl got the ability to handle regular expressions, and network sockets (excerpt from [Geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/perl-tutorial-learn-perl-with-examples)).

**CPAN** - Comprehensive Perl Archive Network
